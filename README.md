# code-refactor
Here is a list of the things I did to consolidate and organze (refactor) the html and css code for the website Horiseon. This process was done in order to make this website more accessible to users.
1. I changed the title to Horiseon.
2. I changed a lot of tags, as follows...
   1. I removed div class=header and made it a header tag.
   2. I changed the div tag to a main tag.
   3. I changed another div to section.
   4. "    "      "      "  "  main.
   5. "    "      "      "  "  article.
3. I inserted id="search-engine-optimization" so that on the website, when you clicked on the SEO in the header, it would take you to the image below in the webpage.
4. I gave the images alt tags so that if the image did not load on the website for some reason, the text representing that picture would show.
5.  I thoroughly commented the CSS file, including lines of code that I changed.
6.  I commented the changes I made to the html file as well.
